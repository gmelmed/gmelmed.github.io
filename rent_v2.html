                        The United States is facing a once-in-a-generation housing affordability crisis. In mid 2022, a typical american renter devoted a greater share of her income to rent <a href="https://www.moodyscre.com/insights/market-insights/q2-2024-housing-affordability-update/#:~:text=National%20Rent%2Dto%2DIncome%20Ratio,from%2027.8%25%20a%20year%20earlier."> than at any point this century</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The map below shows median gross rent as a share of household income in every US county. Households that pay more that 30% of their income on rent are officially considered "rent burdened". A typical renter is near or above this threshold in all of America's population centers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A secondary goal for this project was to reflect the true population density of the US while showing regional trends. US population density doesn’t lend itself well to straightforward choropleths, so I find Dorling cartograms like these to be more informative. I made the cartogram shapefile above using <a href="">this R code</a> from Kieran Healy.

                    <p>
                        Rents surged in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic as surging demand met chronically low supply. The crisis peaked in mid-2022, with rents growing nearly twice as fast as overall prices.

                        I decided to use Zillow’s Observed Rent Index (ZORI) for this project. Zillow has monthly data stretching back nearly ten years and they calculate the figure such that it doesn’t over-index on new housing. Zillow doesn’t have a free and API and their download links sometimes change. Properly harvesting the data links from the site was a significant challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To understand the American housing market, it helps to understand where people are moving. New York, Illinois, and California – home to the three largest cities in the US – are hemorrhaging population, while the south and mountain west have seen large gains. Housing costs are a major driver away from major coastal cities and toward the "sun belt." 
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">

                    <p>
                        Again, I think a cartogram is more useful than a chloropleth map here. I made the shapefile using pitch interactive’s tilegram maker.

                    <h5>Mapping Rent Changes</h5>
                    <p>
                        The first map below shows the change in ZORI over the past five years by county. Few counties have been immune from spiking rents. The southeast and southwest saw the greatest increases in rent and their populations surged. Florida seems to be the most impacted.
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <figure id="Location4"></figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The one-year view tells a different story. Over the past year, rent inflation is felt most acutely in the midwest and northeast. In the sun belt, rent inflation has leveled off. A small handful of counties, mostly in the Texas, even saw their rent index <i>decrease</i> over the past year.
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <figure id="Location5"></figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        One limitation of the Zillow data: ZORI is fairly robust in its coverage, but you’ll notice several smaller counties are missing from these cartograms. To appear on the map, a county must have data for the most recent period and one or five years prior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Zillow also has a variable called the Zillow Observed Rent Demand Index (ZORDI). It measures the traffic on a typical listing in an area. In essence, it's a barometer of <i>competition</i> for available units in each metro area. Despite the name, ZORDI says more about the supply side of the market. In metro areas with high ZORDI scores, renters face greater competition for available units. Below, I compare year-on-year change in ZORI and ZORDI for the 50 largest metro areas in the US.

                    <p>
                        At the opposite end of the spectrum stands Austin, which is emerging as a beacon of housing
                        affordability amid a national rental crisis. With more than 10 new multi-unit structures per
                        10,000
                        people—the second-highest building rate nationally—Austin has managed to buck the trend of steep
                        rent increases plaguing other major metros.<sup id="fn4-ref"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The next chart provides further evidence of a supply-driven market dynamic. It plots the same 50
                        metro areas, comparing rent inflation against the Zillow Observed Rent Demand Index (ZORDI),
                        which
                        measures the typical traffic a rental listing receives on their site. While "rent demand" might
                        suggest total market activity, ZORDI actually captures the level of interest each individual
                        rental
                        listing attracts. In essence, it's a barometer of <i>competition</i> for available units in each
                        metro area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This visualization presents almost a mirror image of the previous chart. Metro areas
                        experiencing
                        the steepest rent increases typically show the lowest ZORDI scores. The contrast between our
                        previous extreme examples, Austin and Hartford, becomes even more striking here—their positions
                        flip. Renters face extreme competition in Hartford and very little in Austin.<sup id="fn5-ref"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>

                    <p>
                        As some of the maps above show, Florida has been one of the hardest-hit states in the rent crisis. The sunshine state consistently has some of the highest rent to income ratios in the nation. In the past five years, Florida has seen some of the most explosive rent growth in the country. This due in part to a surge in housing demand - no state has gained more population since 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Homebuilding in Florida's major cities has been relatively high, but not enough to accomodate its surging population. That is, not everywhere. The charts below show homebuilding and rent growth in Florida's four major metro areas, which account for more than half of its population. 
                    </p>

                        Orlando and Jacksonville have built more homes than the rest of the state and have seen their rent growth slow as a result. Rents are still extremely high, to be sure, but they have leveled off. If these cities's building rates keep pace, incomes should eventually catch up to rents.

                            To measure rent for this project, I am using Zillow's Observed Rent Index (ZORI). Zillow
                            describes ZORI as:
                        <blockquote>
                            A smoothed measure of the typical observed market rate rent across a given region. ZORI is a
                            repeat-rent index that is weighted to the rental housing stock to ensure representativeness
                            across the entire market, not just those homes currently listed for-rent. The index is
                            dollar-denominated by computing the mean of listed rents that fall into the 35th to 65th
                            percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region, which is weighted to
                            reflect the rental housing stock.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            ZORI is a mean figure, but since it excludes the highest and lowest percentiles, it is not
                            heavily affected by extreme values. It also accounts for seasonality:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            What’s available to rent at any given time can change rapidly, and measures of median or
                            average prices across time may not reflect actual market-based movements in rent prices, but
                            instead simply reflect the fact that certain unit types are available at different times.
                            ZORI solves this challenge by calculating price differences for the same rental unit over
                            time, then aggregating those differences across all properties repeatedly listed for rent on
                            Zillow.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            For more on ZORI, see <a
                                href="https://www.zillow.com/research/methodology-zori-repeat-rent-27092/">Zillow's
                                methodology.</a>

                            I scraped the ZORI data from the Zillow's website. I used the FRED API to get the Consumer
                            Price
                            Index (CPI) for all urban consumers. I built the chart using vega-lite.<a

                            Cost of living and remote work aren't the only factors driving Americans to the sun belt.
                            People also argue that these areas are gaining population because (i) the US is an ageing
                            country and the sun belt contains many popular retirement areas, (ii) sun belt states,
                            especially in the south, tend to have lower taxes, (iii) many of these states, like Texas,
                            Georgia, and North Carolina, are booming economies in their own right, and (iv) crime and
                            other quality-of-life issues have risen in major cities. The reasons people give typically
                            depend on their politics, but almost every observer agrees that housing costs play a major
                            role.

                            allows the user to input data in csv format and generates a topojson of the US with states
                            sized by the provided data. I used the most recent US Census population data for this map.
                            Like the last maps, I opted for a cartogram rather than a map to give a sense of population
                            density. I built the map using vega-lite.<a href="#fn2-ref">↩</a>

                            This chart uses the same Zillow data as the previous chart. I calculated YoY change using
                            python. I built the map using D3 and mapbox. The D3 spec for this map uses the most recent
                            ZORI data for each county. For population data, I used 2023 US Census figures. To locate
                            conties on the map, I used the latitude and longitude of population centroids (rather than
                            the geographic centers of counties), also from the US Census. The goal of this map is to
                            show how rent inflation is distributed across the US while providing an accurate picture of
                            the population density.<a href="#fn3-ref">↩</a>

                            I acquired the homebuilding data from the US Census Bureau using their API. I chose to focus
                            on multi-unit structures because they are the most likely to be rented. To calculate
                            homebuilding per capita, I used metro are population figures from the 2023 US Census. I
                            calculated the homebuilding rate using python. I built the chart using vega-lite.<a

                            Like ZORI, I acquired ZORDI data by scraping Zillow's website. Zillow makes all of this
                            information easily downloadable on their website, but does not offer an API for their public
                            data. Strange.<a href="#fn5-ref">↩</a>
