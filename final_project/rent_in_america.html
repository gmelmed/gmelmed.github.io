            <h3>Rent Inflation</h3>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The surge in rent prices is not simply the result of post-pandemic inflation. The chart below shows the year-on-year change in rent prices and inflation since 2016. Rent inflation outpaced overall inflation for years before the pandemic began. During the immediate recovery from the pandemic (late 2021-mid 2022), rent prices rose an order of magnidute faster than overall prices. Thankfully, rent inflation has slowed down, but it's still outpacing inflation in most places.
            </p>
            <p>
                To build this chart, I scraped data from the Zillow's Observed Rent Index (ZORI). ZORI is my preferred rent statistic because ___. I used the FRED API to get the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers. I built the chart using vega-lite.

            <h3>Mapping Rent</h3>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The rent crisis is not felt equally across the US. The map below shows the year-on-year change in rent prices in US counties, which are sized by population.Rent inflation is felt most accutely in the midwest and northeast. On the west coast, rent inflation is low.  A small handful of counties, mostly in the Texas, saw their rent index decrease over the past year. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This chart uses the same Zillow data as the previous chart. I built the map using D3 and mapbox. The D3 spec for this map uses the most recent ZORI data for each county.

            <h3>A Supply Crunch</h3>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                I hope the above visualizations have motivated the rent issue and given a sense of the scale of the current crisis. But what's causing it? I would argue that the root cause of the rent crisis is a lack of housing supply in the areas where people want to live. When supply is low, renters have to compete for a limited number of units, which gives landlords room to charge higher rents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The points below represent the fifty largest metro areas in the US, their year-on-year rent inflation, and the number of new multi-unit housing structures approved this year per 10,000 people.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chart below shows seems to support the supply chrunch thesis - the metro areas with the highest rent inflation tend to have the lowest home building rates. Note the extreme cases at the corners of this chart. Austin, TX has the highest home building rate and the lowest rent inflation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Home building data for this chart comes from the US Census Bureau's Building Permits Survey. I acquired the data using the Census Beaureau's API. I chose to focus only on multi-unit structures because those are most likely to be rented. I built the chart using vega-lite.

                When we examine Zillow's Rent Demand Index (ZORDI), we a similar story. ZORDI measures the typical traffic that a rental listing recieves on their site. I would argue that "rent demand" is a slight misnomer - ZORDI measures the amount of traffic <i>for a given rental</i> in a metro area, not the total amount of traffic in that area. We can consider ZORDI a measure of the <i>competition</i> for rental units in a given area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chart below shows the ZORDI and rent inflation for the fifty largest metro areas in the US, which are sized by population. Remarkably, the chart below is approximately the reverse of the previous chart. The metro areas with the highest rent inflation tend to have the lowest ZORDI scores. Note the extreme cases of Austin, Texas and Hartford, Connecticut. Austin has second-lowest ZORDI score and the lowest rent inflation. Hartford has the highest rent inflation and the second-highest rent inflation.
