                        The United States is facing a once-in-a-generation housing affordability crisis. In mid 2022, a
                        typical
                        american renter devoted a greater share of her income to rent <a
                            href="https://www.moodyscre.com/insights/market-insights/q2-2024-housing-affordability-update/#:~:text=National%20Rent%2Dto%2DIncome%20Ratio,from%2027.8%25%20a%20year%20earlier.">than
                            at any point this century</a>. Housing is chronically undersupplied in most of the places
                        where
                        people want to live, and the crisis was made acute when demand for housing surged in the wake of
                        the
                        COVID-19 pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The map below shows median gross rent as a share of household income. Households that pay more that 30% of their income on rent are officially considered "rent burdened". From the map below, we can see that the typical renter is burdened in practically all of America's population centers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Happily, the crisis peaked in mid-2022. This is little comfort to millions of Americans whose
                        rent
                        is
                        still eating up more of their monthly budget than ever before, but it does mean that explosive
                        rent
                        growth has ended in many areas. Policy makers throughout the country (mainly in the south and
                        southwest)
                        have recognized the crisis and taken steps to address it by unlocking abundant housing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not all areas are so lucky, however. Recovery has been uneven and the crisis is still raging in
                        many
                        parts of the country. This project aims to explore the geography of the rent crisis in the US,
                        understand the factors that drive rent inflation, and highlight effective policy solutions.

                    <p>
                        First, a brief note on my choice of rent rather than home values as my variable of interest:
                        Home
                        values
                        have also exploded in the past five years, but I consider them mostly out of the scope of this
                        project.
                        I chose to focus on rent two two reasons. First, rent it is a more immediate concern for most
                        middle-
                        and lower-income Americans who do not own their home. Relatedly, Americans who own their homes
                        do
                        not
                        necessarily consider the events of the past five years to be a crisis. In fact, many homeowners
                        have
                        seen their net worth increase dramatically with their home values. For renters, the past five
                        years
                        have
                        been a crisis.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Rent Inflation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The surge in rent prices is not simply the result of post-pandemic inflation.The chart below
                        shows
                        the year-on-year change in rent prices and inflation since 2016. Rent inflation outpaced overall
                        inflation for years before the pandemic began and immediately after the pandemic, rent prices
                        rose
                        an order of magnitude faster than overall prices. Since this peak, rent inflation has slowed to
                        around pre-pandemic levels in the past year. Currently, rent inflation is only outpacing overall
                        inflation by less than a percentage point. This national trend conceals a great deal of regional
                        variation, however. As the proceeding charts will demonstrate, some places have brought their
                        rent
                        growth under control, while others are still in the throes of a housing crisis.<sup

                    <h2>Where are Americans Moving?</h2>
                    <p>
                        To understand America's rent crisis, it helps to understand which areas are gaining and losing
                        population. The map below shows population change from 2020 to 2023 by state. Since the
                        pandemic,
                        hundreds of thousands of people have moved away from large states with major cities. New York,
                        California, and Illinois experienced the biggest losses. Meanwhile, the states in the 'sun belt'
                        (roughly, the southeast, southwest, and mountain west) has seen the largest population gains.
                        The
                        primary driver of this migration is the cost of living. Housing costs in major coastal cities
                        and
                        Chicago have become prohibitive for many Americans, who are seeking cheaper (and warmer) areas
                        as a
                        result. This has been helped along by the rise of remote work - many Americans are no longer
                        tied to
                        their place of employment and can live wherever they want.<sup id="fn2-ref"><a
                                href="#fn2">2</a></sup>

                    <h2>Mapping Rent</h2>
                    <p>
                        Not all areas have experienced the same rent inflation. The first map below shows the change in
                        rent
                        index over the past five years by county. Looking at the five-year view, we see few counties
                        have
                        been immune from spiking rents. The southeast and southwest saw the greatest increases in rent.
                        Florida seems to be the most impacted.
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <figure id="Location4"></figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The one-year view tells a different story. Over the past year, rent inflation is felt most
                        acutely
                        in the midwest and northeast. In the sunt belt, rent inflation is near or below overall
                        inflation. A
                        small handful of counties, mostly in the Texas, even saw their rent index <i>decrease</i> over
                        the
                        past year.<sup id="fn3-ref"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <figure id="Location5"></figure>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Who Builds Homes?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I believe the rent crisis is mainly caused by an under-supply of housing in the areas where
                        people
                        want to live. When there are fewer available rental units in an area, renters have to compete
                        for a
                        limited number of homes, which gives landlords room to charge higher rents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider the chart plotting America's 50 largest metro areas, comparing their rent index changes
                        against new multi-unit housing approvals per 10,000 residents this year. A clear pattern
                        emerges:
                        metro areas experiencing the highest rent inflation tend to have the lowest home building rates.
                        This relationship is particularly stark in mid-sized northeastern cities like Hartford,
                        Providence,
                        Buffalo, and Cleveland, where rent inflation exceeds 5.5% while new multi-unit construction
                        languishes at fewer than 2 structures per 10,000 people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the opposite end of the spectrum stands Austin, which is emerging as a beacon of housing
                        affordability amid a national rental crisis. With more than 10 new multi-unit structures per
                        10,000
                        people—the second-highest building rate nationally—Austin has managed to buck the trend of steep
                        rent increases plaguing other major metros.<sup id="fn4-ref"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <figure id="Location6"></figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The next chart provides further evidence of a supply-driven market dynamic. It plots the same 50
                        metro areas, comparing rent inflation against the Zillow Observed Rent Demand Index (ZORDI),
                        which
                        measures the typical traffic a rental listing receives on their site. While "rent demand" might
                        suggest total market activity, ZORDI actually captures the level of interest each individual
                        rental
                        listing attracts. In essence, it's a barometer of <i>competition</i> for available units in each
                        metro area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This visualization presents almost a mirror image of the previous chart. Metro areas
                        experiencing
                        the steepest rent increases typically show the lowest ZORDI scores. The contrast between our
                        previous extreme examples, Austin and Hartford, becomes even more striking here—their positions
                        flip. Renters face extreme competition in Hartford and very little in Austin.<sup

                    <p>
                        As some of the maps above show, Florida has been one of the hardest-hit states in the rent crisis. The sunshine state consistently has some of the highest rent to income ratios in the nation. In the past five years, Florida has seen some of the most explosive rent growth in the country. This due in part to a surge in housing demand - no state has gained more population since 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Homebuilding in Florida's major cities has been relatively high, but not enough to accomodate its surging population. That is, not everywhere. The charts below show homebuilding and rent growth in Florida's four major metro areas, which account for more than half of its population.

                            To measure rent for this project, I am using Zillow's Observed Rent Index (ZORI). Zillow
                            describes ZORI as:
                        <blockquote>
                            A smoothed measure of the typical observed market rate rent across a given region. ZORI is a
                            repeat-rent index that is weighted to the rental housing stock to ensure representativeness
                            across the entire market, not just those homes currently listed for-rent. The index is
                            dollar-denominated by computing the mean of listed rents that fall into the 35th to 65th
                            percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region, which is weighted to
                            reflect the rental housing stock.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            ZORI is a mean figure, but since it excludes the highest and lowest percentiles, it is not
                            heavily affected by extreme values. It also accounts for seasonality:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            What’s available to rent at any given time can change rapidly, and measures of median or
                            average prices across time may not reflect actual market-based movements in rent prices, but
                            instead simply reflect the fact that certain unit types are available at different times.
                            ZORI solves this challenge by calculating price differences for the same rental unit over
                            time, then aggregating those differences across all properties repeatedly listed for rent on
                            Zillow.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            For more on ZORI, see <a

                                methodology.</a>

                            I scraped the ZORI data from the Zillow's website. I used the FRED API to get the Consumer
                            Price
                            Index (CPI) for all urban consumers. I built the chart using vega-lite.<a

                            Cost of living and remote work aren't the only factors driving Americans to the sun belt.
                            People also argue that these areas are gaining population because (i) the US is an ageing
                            country and the sun belt contains many popular retirement areas, (ii) sun belt states,
                            especially in the south, tend to have lower taxes, (iii) many of these states, like Texas,
                            Georgia, and North Carolina, are booming economies in their own right, and (iv) crime and
                            other quality-of-life issues have risen in major cities. The reasons people give typically
                            depend on their politics, but almost every observer agrees that housing costs play a major
                            role.

                            I made this map using Pitch Interactive's <a
                                href="https://pitchinteractiveinc.github.io/tilegrams/">tilegram maker</a>. The app
                            allows the user to input data in csv format and generates a topojson of the US with states
                            sized by the provided data. I used the most recent US Census population data for this map.
                            Like the last maps, I opted for a cartogram rather than a map to give a sense of population
                            density. I built the map using vega-lite.<a href="#fn2-ref">↩</a>

                            This chart uses the same Zillow data as the previous chart. I calculated YoY change using
                            python. I built the map using D3 and mapbox. The D3 spec for this map uses the most recent
                            ZORI data for each county. For population data, I used 2023 US Census figures. To locate
                            conties on the map, I used the latitude and longitude of population centroids (rather than
                            the geographic centers of counties), also from the US Census. The goal of this map is to
                            show how rent inflation is distributed across the US while providing an accurate picture of
                            the population density.<a href="#fn3-ref">↩</a>

                            I acquired the homebuilding data from the US Census Bureau using their API. I chose to focus
                            on multi-unit structures because they are the most likely to be rented. To calculate
                            homebuilding per capita, I used metro are population figures from the 2023 US Census. I
                            calculated the homebuilding rate using python. I built the chart using vega-lite.<a

                            Like ZORI, I acquired ZORDI data by scraping Zillow's website. Zillow makes all of this
                            information easily downloadable on their website, but does not offer an API for their public
                            data. Strange.<a href="#fn5-ref">↩</a>
