            <h2>CC4: Replication.</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Task:</b> Find a chart that a journalist, think tank, television channel or company has used. Your challenge this week is to replicate it, and then improve on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This chart initially appeared in an FT article on the Dollar:
            </p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="chart_specs/ft_example.png" alt="FT chart" width="600" height="400">
                </div>
            <p>
                Yes, even FT is occasionally guilty of publishing the dreaded dual axis chart. If the viewer doesn't pay attention, he may think the Renminbi's share of global reserves is already just behind the dollar. FT released a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3888bdba-d0d6-49a1-9e78-4d07ce458f42">revised version</a> with the two series as a trellis chart with separate scales. This is an improvement, but I still think it obscures the distance that remains between the two currencies. Here is my recreation:
            </p>    
        <figure id="cc4_1"></figure>
            <p>
                And my revised version:
            </p>

        <figure id="cc4_2"></figure>
            <p>
                When both series are on the same scale and other currencies are included, we can see the latter claim is true - the dollar isn't as dominant as it once was. We also see how much the original chart exaggerates the Renminbi's share. It isn't even the fourth most held currency.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref1">2</a></sup>

                For the next visualization, I returned to the life expectancy data I used for my <a href="lifeex.html">policy memo</a> on the subject last year. In it, I argued that life expectancy in the US is diverging by geography and by class. The decline and stagnation of overall life expectancy conceals a great deal of variation. Consider the density plots of life expectancy by county every four years. The distributions gradually become flatter and wider, indicating a widening gap between the shortest- and longest-living areas.

            <h2>CC10: Interactivity.</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Task:</b> Produce two visualizations that have interactive elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                For these visualizations, I continued with the life expectancy data. The first shows life expectancy by state from 2000 to 2019. Moving forward in time, we see how some states are living dramatically longer while other areas are stagnating.
            </p>
            <figure id="cc10_1"></figure>
            <p>
                The second variation shows inequality <i>within</i> states. The plot shows every county in the US, with the user able to select a state from the dropdown menu and highlight its counties. Life expectancy varies widely within some states.
