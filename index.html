        A bit about me - I am Masters student in Data Science for Public Policy at the London School of Economics. My goal is to make data informative and persuasive, no matter now complex. The work on this page is a mix of class assignments and professional data visualizations I've made for <a href ="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/">Economics Observatory</a>.

            <h2>Featured work: Mapping rent changes in the US</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The US is facing a once-in-a-generation housing affordability crisis. Rent prices have increased dramatically over the past five years, outpacing inflation. Since the pandemic, the sun belt (the southeast and southwest) has experienced the largest increases in rent as demand in these areas has surged. Over the past year, however, rent inflation in the sun belt has cooled. A small handful of counties even saw their rent index <i>decrease</i> over the past year. Meanwhile, the northeast and midwest are still experiencing intense rent inflation. These cartograms show the one-year and five-year changes in rent in US counties, which are sized by population.
