    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

            <h2>Peak Blossom of Cherry Blossoms in Kyoto, Japan</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Kyotoâ€™s world-famous cherry blossom trees are blooming earlier and earlier every year. The timing of peak blossom depends on spring temperatures, which are steadily rising. Note the sustained drop since the beginning of the 21st century.

            <h2>Medal Compensation at the 2024 Olympics</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                During the 2024 Olympic Games, I became interested in how countries compensated their athletes for winning medals. Medal compensation is at the discretion of each country's national olympic committee (NOC), and varies significantly. The first chart shows the top 10 NOCs by gold medal compensation.

                Not every NOC compensates their medalist this generously. In fact, most NOCs do not offer any compensation for medalists. For comparison, the next chart shows the top 10 NOCs by 2024 Olympic roster size. Most pay a small fraction of what the top-paying NOCs pay. Note: China is empty because no information is available. Great Britain is empty because team GB medalists are not compensated.
