                        Despite the typical American being materially richer than her counterpart in almost every
                        country in this group, she is expected to die earlier. Beginning around 2010, US life expectancy
                        began to rise slowly compared to other high-income nations. It declined sharply compared to peer
                        countries during the COVID-19 pandemic and has rebounded slower since the pandemic ended. The
                        CDC‚Äôs <a
                            href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/29/life-expectancy-2022-united-states/">provisional
                            figures for 2022</a> indicate life expectancy has ticked up but remains below pre-COVID
                        levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the past two decades, public health experts have been attempting to raise the salience of
                        America‚Äôs life expectancy crisis to little effect. Few national leaders have explicitly named
                        the issue. President Biden has not mentioned the crisis in any public remarks. Some members of
                        congress have proposed declaring a national crisis, but <a
                            href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/12/28/life-expectancy-no-political-response/">they
                            are a small minority.</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This memo makes two points. First, America‚Äôs under-performing life expectancy is not an overall
                        trend, rather a reflection of a decline in outcomes for America‚Äôs lower class. Second, the life
                        expectancy gap is explained by four main factors: obesity-related chronic conditions, the opioid
                        epidemic, gun violence, and motor vehicle deaths.

                    <h3>
                        Divergence, not Stagnation
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        National-level statistics can be misleading ‚Äì they often obscure divides between regions and
                        subgroups in a population. This is the case with US life expectancy. Looking at the US‚Äôs overall
                        life expectancy, one might think life expectancy is stagnating for all Americans as it increases
                        in other rich countries. When we examine <a
                            href="https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-life-expectancy-by-county-race-ethnicity-2000-2019">county-level
                            data</a> from The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation‚Äôs Global Health Data Exchange
                        (Henceforth IHME and GHDX), we see life expectancy is not stagnating but <i>diverging</i>. There
                        is a large and growing gap between the longest- and shortest-living Americans. The map below
                        shows US counties by the change in their life expectancy from 2000 to 2019.

                        This map reveals an urban-rural divide. the counties that lost years of life expectancy are
                        overwhelmingly in rural areas (with the notable exception of the mountain west). Meanwhile urban
                        counties tended to gain years (the largest increase was recorded by New York County, NY). Life
                        expectancy also reveals regional inequality - improving counties tend to be in urban areas in
                        coastal regions while declining counties are concentrated in the Midwest and Appalachian
                        regions. If American policymakers are to tackle the country‚Äôs life expectancy crisis, they must
                        focus attention, personnel, and resources in these areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As one may infer from the map above, life expectancy is also highly correlated with income. When
                        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2016.4226">Chetty et. Al. 2016</a> compared tax records to
                        death records from 1999 to 2016, they revealed ‚Äúhigher income was associated with greater
                        longevity throughout the income distribution.‚Äù The authors also found ‚Äúdifferences in life
                        expectancy across income groups increased over time."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Life expectancy gaps between the rich and poor are to be expected in any country, but they are
                        especially large in the US. The gap between the richest and poorest Americans is far larger than
                        the gap between the richest and poorest Europeans. <a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2104684118">This is especially true for Black
                            Americans.</a>

                    <p>
                        Other researchers have focused on education-based mortality gaps. <a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1257/app.20190297">Novosad et. Al. 2022</a> examined mortality
                        changes at constant education percentiles. They found from 1992 to 2018, the least educated 10%
                        of Americans (read: high-school dropouts) have faced ‚Äúcatastrophic" increases in early mortality
                        while mortality in other education bands stagnated or decreased.

                        COVID-19 accounted for a sharp life expectancy reduction in virtually all countries, including
                        the US.<sup id="fn2-ref"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> COVID infections, hospitalizations, and
                        deaths all <a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7226a5">diverged sharply by class</a> ‚Äì
                        wealthier Americans with remote-compatible jobs were able to stay home and avoid infection.
                        After the introduction of COVID vaccines, rural Americans were vaccinated at <a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7109a2">far lower rates</a> than urban Americans,
                        compounding the urban-rural expectancy gap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Underperforming life expectancy is not a nationwide issue but a sign of inequality and neglect ‚Äì
                        the US is failing to ensure its rural, poor, and less educated citizens live long and healthy
                        lives.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Causes</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is no single cause for the US‚Äôs under-performing life expectancy. The figure represents a
                        culmination of several factors related to Americans‚Äô health, wellbeing, and safety. The chart
                        below uses GHDX data to compare age-standardized years of life lost due to different risk
                        factors in 2019 in the same set of 20 rich countries from the chart above. Risk factors include
                        behavioral (which include tobacco, alcohol, and substance abuse), environmental (unclean air and
                        water, occupational hazards), and metabolic risks (mostly related to obesity). We can see the
                        gap between the US and peer countries is driven primarily by behavioral and metabolic risks.
                        While analysts debate the relative gravity of individual factors, a consensus has emerged that
                        the US‚Äôs life expectancy under-performs due to <a
                            href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2023/american-life-expectancy-dropping/">four
                            main factors:</a> (i) obesity and its attendant chronic conditions, (ii) the opioid
                        epidemic, (iii) gun violence, and (iv) motor vehicle deaths. The latter two are not captured by
                        the risk factors in the chart, so the gap shown below is likely an underestimate.

                        In 2005, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsr043743">a team of researchers warned</a> in the
                        New England journal of medicine that increases in US obesity could halt decades of progress in
                        life expectancy. A <a
                            href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2023/american-life-expectancy-dropping/">recent
                            analysis from the Washington Post</a> finds chronic conditions such as heart disease,
                        diabetes, hypertension, liver disease, and kidney disease (all of which are highly correlated
                        with obesity) ‚Äúerase more than twice as many years of life among people younger than 65 as all
                        the overdoses, homicides, suicides and car accidents combined.‚Äù

                    <p>
                        The US is an extreme outlier in obesity among rich nations. This is driven in large part by food
                        deserts, which lead to highly unhealthy diets and are concentrated in the poor and rural areas
                        highlighted above.

                    <p>
                        Breaking down the behavioral risks shown in figure 3, we see the gap in years of life lost due
                        to behavioral risks is driven primarily by drug use. For the past two decades, the US has
                        experienced an opioid epidemic. This epidemic has concentrated in the regions with declining
                        life expectancy shown above. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226732">Glei and
                            Preston 2020</a> estimate that from 1998 to 2016, drug use reduced male expectancy by 1.4
                        years and female expectancy by 0.7. In West Virginia, the most affected state, reductions were
                        3.6 and 1.9 years.

                        In addition to COVID-19, gun violence accounted for the sharp decline in life expectancy in 2020
                        and 2021. Homicides <a

                        in the US during these years. Even before the recent spike, the US was an outlier in
                        firearm-related deaths. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2018-111103">Kalesan et. Al.
                            2018</a> estimate that gun violence accounts for 21% of the male life expectancy gap between
                        the US and other high-income countries. Breaking the data down by race, they find the gap is
                        especially large for Black men.

                        Among rich countries, the US is an outlier in road fatalities per capita. This is for several
                        reasons. American cars tend to be far larger than cars in peer countries, <a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecotra.2021.100219">resulting in more pedestrian deaths.</a>
                        A greater share of Americans <a

                        speeding and driving without a seatbelt than in peer countries. Furthermore, the built
                        environment in American municipalities makes driving the dominant form of transportation. Not
                        only does this lead to more road fatalities through increased driving, but it also <a

                        Life expectancy reflects a convergence of policy outcomes affecting lower-class Americans.
                        Fortunately, the origins of this crisis are no great mystery. We know the main factors driving
                        the crisis. Obesity-related chronic conditions, opioids, gun violence, and motor vehicle deaths
                        leave little to be explained. Unfortunately, these are all disparate issues, each with complex
                        and politically fraught solutions.

                            5 years longer than male life expectancy. While the reasons for Male and Female mortality in
                            America vary, the difference of 5 years has been remarkably stable since 2000. For this
                            reason, this memo will refer almost entirely to the unified figures for both men and
